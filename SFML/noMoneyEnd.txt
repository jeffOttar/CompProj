As you used up your last bit of money you felt a chill
run down your spine. You took a moment to ponder how
it turned out this way, and didn't see the shadow
looming over you. With a THWACK you found yourself
lying on the ground. As the blood ran out of your
body and pooled around you in your store, you saw
the smiling face of your murderer. Courtney sat there
as she watched you slowly die, whispering under her 
breath... "only those useful to Marco remain"
with a final breath your body felt lighter as you 
died on this dreary day. You were only left of the 
thought of how you disappointed Marco.
