As you hyped yourself up for the opportunity to meet
Marco you thought of how lucky you were to accumulate
all of the money you have. Surely it must have been
Marco Miracle. As you gathered up your money to 
offer up to the greatest being in existence you
shivered in antipation. Soon you would meet Marco
the being who parted the binary seas, spreading the
1s and 0s for the worthy to pass. He created the world
from scratch on a Linux system, using C++ and PHP. 
He is the most important, all powerfull being and you
will be meeting him. As a tear of joy fell from your
eye you felt a sharp pain and collapsed to the ground.
Looking up all you could see was the sky but you 
thought that you caught a glimpse of Marco beckoning 
you to the sky. As your conscious faded away you 
heard a familiar voice say that you are not worthy
to meet the supreme being.
